# Boundary-integral-equations-in-a-circle
We set up our model problem, discuss the double-layer formulation, and outline the solution via the Nystr√∂m method using spline Gaussian rules.


## Model problem
We solve the Dirichlet boundary value problem in a circle via converting it into 1D problem - the Fredholm
integral equation on the boundary of the domain.
